TODO: 	
Test password verify   	
Make it pretty  	
Add version control 	

Password verification is untested with php 5.5	
The default password is password	
Possible ideas for version control: 	
Make a number of folders in the file folder, and whenever a file is uploaded the previous version of the file is moved to the first folder. If there is a file in the first folder, that file will be maved to the second folder and so on	
Atuomatically back up the files on the server and have users request a rollback for a file from the sysadmin
