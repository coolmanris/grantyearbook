Add version control 	

The default password is granthighschoolyearbook	
Possible ideas for version control: 	
Make a number of folders in the file folder, and whenever a file is uploaded the previous version of the file is moved to the first folder. If there is a file in the first folder, that file will be moved to the second folder and so on	
Automatically back up the files on the server and have users request a rollback for a file from the sysadmin
